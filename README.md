# Feed Reader Testing Project Overview

Feed Reader Testing Project tested my ability to use a testing suite (Jasmine), to check the functionalites of the code written.

## Implemented tests

1. Tests for allfeeds has been defined and that it is not empty
2. Tests for allFeeds have a url and that the url is not empty
3. Tests for allFeeds have a name and that the name is not empty
4. Searches for the class of 'menu-hidden' in the body tag and checks that the menu is hidden
5. Toggles on click event if the menu appears or disappears
6. Tests if the loadFeed function has at least a single '.entry' within the '.feed' container
7. Tests to see if two entries are not equal
